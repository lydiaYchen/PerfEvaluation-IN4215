(I am update the page. Will be done by the September 15.)


## Lecture 1-2: Design of Experiments 

In this lecture, you will learn how to compare computing systems/algorithms with different configurations, using statistical tests, e.g., ANOVA tests and confidence intervals. Moreover, you will learn how to design "efficient experiments" to figure out the the critical factors and the impact of their levels, e.g., regression.

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.

### Recommended readings
- The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: chapter 16, 17, 19, 29, 21, and 23
- Design and Analysis of Experiments: chapter 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 


## Lecture 3: Operational Law 

In this lecture, you will learn some simple and powerful operational laws that can provide a quick first order prediction of the computing systems, such as the little's law, the utilization and the bottleneck. You will be able to pinpoint the bottleneck resources of the systems and provide the approximation of job response times.

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.

### Recommended readings
- Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems: Queuing Theory in Action: chapter 6 and 7
- The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: chapter 33



## Lecture 4: Probability and Statistic Review 

In this lecture, you will refresh your basic knowledge about probability and statistics. You will learn how to derive the mean and standard deviations of known probability functions, e.g., Binomial, Normal, Exponential, and Poisson. You will also learn how to compute the estimators of the probability functions given a data set. 

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.

### Recommended readings
- Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems: Queuing Theory in Action: chapter 3
-  The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: chapter 12 and 13
- Design and Analysis of Experiments: chapter 2






## Lecture 5-8: Stochastis models and queueing Model 

In this lecture, you will learn how to derive stochastic models, being discrete and continuous Markovian chains, for computing systems, e.g., datacenters, and web services. You will learn a range of queueing models that can predict and approximate the response times of computing jobs. With those models, you will be answer the design questions like number of cores, virtual machines and containers for different applications. 

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.

### Recommended readings

- The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: chapter 30, 31




## Lecture 9-10: Machine learning models


In this lecture, you will learn how to predict failure behaviors of computer systems using machine learning models. You will learn the theories behind a range of machine learning models from decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, to neural networks.  

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.

### Recommended readings

## Lecture 11-12: Optimization and Simulation  

In this lecture, you will learn the tricks of deriving and simplifying optimization problems, e.g., server energy minimizing problem constrained by the latency. You will also learn the numerical optimization solution, e.g., stochastic gradient methods. Finally, you will learn the principles of building a simulation to validate your developed systems and models.

The lectures slides (PDF) are available in ILIAS.
