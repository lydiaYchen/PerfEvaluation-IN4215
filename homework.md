## Homework Structure
> In short, there are 3 peer reviewed homeworks. TA staff will be available online weekly for questions. Additionally there will be 3 offline tutorial sessions to discuss the exercises prepare for the peer review.

Throughout the course, we will cover various topics for Quantative Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems (QPECS). Part of your evaluation will consist of peer-reviewed homework problem sets. Grading is done through peer reviews; as such, both your solutions and reviews submitted by you will influence your homework grade.

The Homework release cycle will consist of 5 stages.

1.  *Release of the homework:* Netflix-style, i.e., are available on Ilias from the start of the course. Errata/clarifications will be uploaded on Ilias in case they are needed, so make sure to check Ilias for updated content.
2.  *Submission of homework on Ilias:* Last Friday before the scheduled tutorial session.
    1.  Upon the deadline's passing, an assignment of peer-review pairs (students --> solutions) is automatically be made.
3.  **In-person classroom instruction**: Offline instruction session, where we will review the exercises and discuss questions and remarks. This session will serve as a starting point for your peer review.
4.  *Peer-review submission:* Use your knowledge from working on the exercises and flipped-classroom session to review your peers' solutions.

## Q&A + Classroom instructions

QPECS' TA staff is available weekly during online Q&A sessions, where you can pose your questions.

The in-person classroom sessions are scheduled during the classroom sessions; TA staff will be present offline to go over the exercises and discuss questions. Note that the offline sessions will be a in-classroom tutorial setting, providing a two-fold opportunity to 1) check your understanding of the exercises and ask questions, 2) prepare for and get started with the peer review.

## Pointers for Submitting to Ilias

> In short, submit a single file (PDF) on Ilias in an anonymized format (NO STUDENT ID, NO NAME, NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION). Ensure to 1) show intermediate steps, 2) add partial solutions, and 3) have the document well-structured.

Work in a structured document to make reviewing easy for your peers. We advise using LaTeX / Markdown with Math(Jax) typesetting for your final submission. Use one of the following approaches to render/compile your homework solution report (as well as work on a draft version first on paper).

⚠️ Make sure to submit partial solutions! A single number/claim (unless specifically requested by the exercise) makes reviewing difficult.

⚠️ You may want to include scanned versions of written solutions in your submission. However, ensure the work is readable for your peers; illegible (parts of) submissions are graded as incomplete/incorrect.


### Tips for Your Report

We advise the following two ways of creating a report of your solutions to submit to Ilias.

- In case you are unfamiliar with LaTeX typesetting, we advise using Jupter Notebook and submitting a PDF version of your solutions to Ilias. M Jupyter Notebook allows you to combine easily: 1) code with its output 2) text and math typesetting for equations through Markdown and MathJax 3) externally rendered images.
- Otherwise, you can use a LaTeX/Markdown document (e.g. through [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) or [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)), and include figures, tables, etc., from scripts as well as and code in codeblocks (using `listings` or `solarized-light` [stackoverflow](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/475826/how-to-present-a-python-code-snippet-efficiently-in-latex)).

⚠️ Whichever format you intend to use, ensure you can (easily) generate a PDF version to submit.

📚 In case you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, we provide the following links to get started:

- [a quick start guide for Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- See examples for [inline math](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/math.html#in-line-math), and [math blocks](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/math.html#math-blocks).
- Converting (Excel) tables to Markdown / Latex ... use [tables generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

## Pointers for Reviews

> Note this only serves as a general pointer; the Ilias Peer review environment will provide additional details.

Your submission of solutions and peer review will be made through Ilias. Each student will automatically be assigned the work of 2 peers to review. For the peer review, the course leverages a 1 to 5 rating system for each (sub-)exercise, allowing you to grade your peers' solutions ranging from;

1.  completely incorrect,
2.  partial solution / only correct answer,
3.  partially correct chain-of-thought but wrong answer,
4.  (Mostly) correct chain-of-thought and correct answer,
5.  Completely correct chain-of-thought and correct answer.

The weighted grade of reviewers, combined with your submitted reviews' consistency with other reviewers, will be used to calculate your final homework grade.
