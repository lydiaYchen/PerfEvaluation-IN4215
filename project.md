# Performance modeling project

## There are three expected milestones:

1. **Project proposal** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 3
2. **Intermediate project meeting** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 6
3. **Final project report** (mandatory, graded): due on week 9
4. **15 min project presentation**

**Group projects are conducted in groups of 2-3 students. Please enroll together with your team members in group on Brightspace - we have predefined XXX different groups, take your pick! !**

## Grading breakdown
- Final report: 80%
- 15 min project presenation: 20 %

## Evaluation criteria



## Choosing topics

You first choose a published paper that describes performance evalution, modeling, and resource managment.

Based on both types of papers, we have created two lists of papers that are well suited for the group project. Several groups can choose the same paper to reproduce (though of course it is more interesting for us instructors if that does not happen too often). To be clear: **collaborations across groups are not allowed** - every group has to work independently.

Note that **reproducibility does not mean to create an exact replica of the original paper** (that would be replicability), instead [reproducibility](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) asks the question whether the idea is reproducible by a different team, a slightly different experimental setup and independently developed artifacts.
[This interesting paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b95a/11620929f1c4760587ac99a8d6b4d8cbc547.pdf) on algorithm reproducibility (in particular Table 2!) may give you inspirations for what to look out for in terms of reproducibility.





## Report formats

### Project proposal

The proposal should contain between 300 and 400 words. Your proposal should address the following points:

1. Problem description: which problem will you tackle and what is interesting about the problem? If you reproduce a paper make sure to reference the original paper.
2. Resources: which data and tools will you be using (this includes also existing implementations of algorithms
3. Methodology: if you choose to reproduce a paper, tell us which part of the paper (if not all) you will reproduce; if you choose your own research idea, tell us what type of algorithm/approach you are proposing and what your baseline(s) will be
4. Background readings: list at least 5 related papers that you will read to add context to your research
5. Evaluation: how will you evaluate your algorithm/approach? Which evaluation metrics will you use?

**Submission**: every group uploads their proposal on Brightspace. The proposal should be in PDF format and should contain the group name and the list of group members (name, student IDs).

**Feedback**: the course team will provide feedback on the project proposal within a few days.

### Intermediate and final project report

The **final** group project report should be **6-7 pages** long in the [SIG XX proceedings format](https://sigchi.org/templates/) (available as LaTeX and Word templates) - even if the paper you originally chose to reproduce is 2 or 4 pages long, we still expect your report to adhere to the 6-7 page limit (think about the related work, implementation issues, analyses of results, etc. that are often underdeveloped in short papers). 
[//]: # (The **intermediate** project report is likely to be shorter (it is due a week before the final deadline), that is fine, submit whatever you have by then.)

We suggest the following report structure:

- Title, authors
- Abstract
- Introduction: problem statement, motivation for the problem, overall plan to tackle the problem
- Background: what important works does this project build on
- Approach: what methods/algorithms did you use
- Experiments: describe your experiments, the results and discuss them
- Conclusions: describe what you learnt/found and what avenues for future work you see
- References

The final report should also contain a link to a repository (or several) that contain the software you created, the scripts you used to analyze your data, etc.

Submission: every group uploads their intermediate and final group project reports on Brightspace. The reports should be in PDF format. Note that after submission a plagiarism check is executed by Turnitin - please make sure to follow the academic rules of writing ([you can read them up here one more time](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/copyright/c/plagiarism/)).

In addition, your report must also include a figure that graphically depicts a major component of your project (e.g., your approach and how it relates to the application, etc.). Such a summary figure makes your paper much more accessible by providing a visual counterpart to the text. Developing such a concise and clear figure can actually be quite time-consuming; I often go through around ten versions before I end up with a good final version.

The final project report is graded in combination with the project interview. The interview will be an academic discussion about the executed project.

## Interviews

The 15 minute interviews per group will be scheduled on **March 14** and **March 15**.
