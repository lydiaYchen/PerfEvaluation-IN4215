## Course description

<img style="float:right;" src="img/library.png" width="200px">


Todays computing systems become ever complex, due to the rapid development of hardware and software technology.  It is challenging to design and run computing systems that guarantee usersâ€™ performance requirements in a resource efficient way. Various quantitative methods are applied to capture such complex system dynamics and predict metrics of interests, from the designing phase of the systems to the runtime performance, e.g., job response times and system anomaly.  To optimize the performance of computing systems, a deep understanding on those methods and their applications on the system design are essential. Having practical hand-on experience on designing experiments, deriving models, and validating results with benchmark systems will prepare students to tackle challenges of real systems. 

Course topics include
- Overview on quantitative methods and basics mathematics tools. (week 1)
- Queueing methods for modeling computing systems (week 1 and 2)
- Scheduling and load balancing  (week 3 )
- Machine learning methods for modeling computing systems (week 4 )
- Design of experiments and simulation (week 5)
- System secdurity and scability analysis (week 6)
- Optimization and resource managment (week 7)


## Textbooks

- Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems: Queuing Theory in Action by Mor. Harchol-Balter 
- The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling by Raj Jian
- The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Springer Series in Statistics.


## Course team

This distribution also fits the lecturer team of this course: [Associate Prof. Lydia Y Chen](https://lydiaychen.com//) teaches the core IR lecture. The course team is composed of a number of PhDs (all from the [Distributed System group](http://www.ds.ewi.tudelft.nl/)) who support the course through guest lectures and project supervision and a TA who focuses on the grading of the paper reviews:


-  Taraneh (PhD student)
-  Masoud (PhD student)


Lydia is the responsible instructors of this course and can jointly be reached at **y.chen-10@tudelft.nl**.

## ECs

This is a **5 EC course**, with **140 hours** of course work in total. We expect you to spread the load evenly across the 9 course weeks.

## Learning objectives

- Apply queueing and machine-learning models to analyze performance of modern computing systems, e.g., web servers, cloud systems, machine learning clusters, and datacenters.
- Derive models to predict the performance of selected computing system designs, e.g., the average latency, failure, energy consumption, and scalability
- Design experiments to profile applications and their workloads, extracting key inputs for the derived queueing and machine-learning models
- Develop resource provisioning policies and validate them on real computing systems


## :dart: Grading policy

This course has no final exam, instead the grade is largely determined through three components: 

1. Homework (50%): 2 individual homework due in week 4 and 7. Each homework accounts 25% of the grade and cover 3 weeks material. Homework will be given in week 1 and 4. Students have three weeks time to complete them. 
2. Group project (50%): group project report (40%) and presentation (10%). There will be 7 predefined projects students can choose from. There will be an interim discussion with each team in week 6. The final report will be due in week 9, and 20 minutes presentation in week 9 as well.


**All assessment items (reviews, projects reports) have to be submitted via Brightspace.**


### Homework
- Homework 1: due in week 4
- Homework 4: due in week 7

### Group projects
- 7 predefined project topics: evaluting the systems of 
- Group size: 2-3 students
- Schedule: interim meeting (week 6), report due (week 9), and presntation/interview (week 9)

At the end of each project phase we will conduct a short interview (20 minutes per group) about the group project and its connection to the course content. Based on the project report and the interview, each member of the group receives a grade. 



In order to pass this course, you need to fullfil **all** of the following:
1. Receive an overall grade of 5.8 or higher (in alignment with TU Delft's exam regulations). 
2. Each homework and project at least a grade of 5.0.


## Detailed schedule
- Week1: DoE 1 (done) and DoE 2 (done)
- Week2: Operation laws (done) and probability review
- Week3: DTMC/CTMC (done) and queueing theory (done)
- Week 4:
- Week5: ML 1 ( Logistic regression, K-means, decision tree, random forest ) and ML 2 (Support vecotr, Neural Network)
- Week6: 
- Week7: Simulation and resource managment


## Collaboration v.s. cheating


You will receive one homework every few weeks. These are meant to reinforce the material that we are learning during that time, so please start immediately. Please do not search the web for help on the homework problems. It is difficult to develop good homework problems, and thus you may come across similar problems if you search the web for help. 

You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on these problems, but each person must write up the final solutions individually. You should note on your homework specifically which problems were a collaborative effort and with whom.
