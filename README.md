##  2. <a name='Coursedescription'></a>Course description




Todays computing systems become ever complex, due to the rapid development of hardware and software technology.  It is challenging to design and run computing systems that guarantee usersâ€™ performance requirements in a resource efficient way. Various quantitative methods are applied to capture such complex system dynamics and predict metrics of interests, from the designing phase of the systems to the runtime performance, e.g., job response times and system anomaly.  To optimize the performance of computing systems, a deep understanding on those methods and their applications on the system design are essential. Having practical hand-on experience on designing experiments, deriving models, and validating results with benchmark systems will prepare students to tackle challenges of real systems. 

Course topics include
- Design of experiments and statistical tests 
- Operational laws and queueing methods for modeling computing systems
- Scheduling and load balancing  
- Machine learning methods for modeling computing systems 
- System security and scalability analysis
- Optimization and resource management

This course will be mainly taught by [Prof. Lydia Y Chen](https://lydiaychen.github.io/)  The course team is composed of a number of PhDs  who support the course through guest lectures and project supervision and a TA who focuses on the grading of homework.

##  5. <a name='Learningobjectives'></a>Learning objectives
- LO1. Design full/fractional factorial experiments for multi-variate regression analysis, e.g., finding critical parameters for deep learning clusters.
- LO2. Apply queueing theory to analyse and predict the run-time performance of applications, e.g., the average response times of on-line ML training service.
- LO3. Apply machine learning models to analyse and predict the system dependability, e.g, root cause analysis for machine failure.
- LO4. Conduct experiments to profile applications and extract their workload parameters on real systems, e.g., deep learning clusters
- LO5. Develop resource management policies and validate them on real computing systems, e.g., deep learning clusters


##  6. <a name='dart:Gradingpolicy'></a>:dart: Grading policy

This course has no final exam, instead the grade is largely determined through three components: 

1. Homework (30%): 3 individual homework due in week 4, 8, 11. Each homework accounts 10  of the grade and cover 3 weeks material. All homework will be released at the begining of the semester.


2. Group project (70%): group project report (60%) and presentation (10%). There will be topics of modeling response times, configuring, dependability, scheduling design. There will be an initial proposal in week 5, interim discussion with each team in week 9. The final report will be due in week 13, and 20 minutes presentation in week 9 as well.


**All assessment items (homework, and projects reports) have to be submitted via ILIAS.**


###  6.1. <a name='Homework'></a>Homework
- Homework 1: due in week 4 
- Homework 2: due in week 8
- Homework 3: due in week 11 

Students are given additional 48 hours grace period for late submission and will not receive any grade penalty. However, submissions after 48 hours grace period will not be considered and students will loose 25 points of their final grade. 


###  6.2. <a name='Groupprojects'></a>Group projects
<!-- 7 predefined project topics: evaluating the systems of 
-->
There are different aspects of performance  on modeling and optimizing the executions of deep neural network jobs. In this project, you will play with benchmarks that emulate the training jobs of deep neural networks on top of Spark platform - one of the most popular platform. You can build a model to predict the performance such jobs, to optimize their response times through resource allocations and scheduling, and to test the dependability of such a cluster against malicious attacks. You will do this project in a group with 1-2 other peers.

- Group size: 2-3 students
- Schedule: initial proposal (week 5), interim meeting (week 9), report due (week 13), and presentation/interview (week 13). 

[UPDATE] We change the requirement. For the final project, you just need to submit ppt slides, which summarize the results. If you submit a report, you will be getting bosnus point.

At the end of each project phase we will conduct a short interview (20 minutes per group) about the group project and its connection to the course content. Based on the project report and the interview, each member of the group receives a grade.

You will receive one homework every few weeks. These are meant to reinforce the material that we are learning during that time, so please start immediately. Please do not search the web for help on the homework problems. It is difficult to develop good homework problems, and thus you may come across similar problems if you search the web for help. 

Each pearson must write up the final solutions individually. If you discussion with classmates, please make sure you still work on your homework individually without copying solutions.
